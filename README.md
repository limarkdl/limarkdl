### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently currently studying at UCLan Cyprus 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software development technologies, especially Frontend 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ikostincyprus@gmail.com
- âš¡ P.S: There are so few public repositories since the most of private repositories are nightmares from the beggining of my studying or are just experiments and I don't want to disgrace :)

[@limarkdl-private](https://github.com/limarkdl-private) - My personal account where I use 3-rd party services (e.g Azure CI/CD pipeline) which want access to my organization, but this does not suit me >:(
